# 3.2 Keep Barry happy

![](./images/white-plane-sky.webp)

Business is booming for Barry's airlines!

To celebrate, Barry decides to take 10,000 flights on his planes

He has a fleet of 100 planes and wants to have the best experience possible across all 10,000 flights

Barry scores his experience by awarding Barry points at the end of each flight.

Each plane is different, so Barry finds them differently rewarding.

However there is some randomness in the flight experience, sometimes a plane's flight crew are having a good day and sometimes they aren't! So the same plane may not get the same number of Barry points for all flights.

## Your task
Barry tasks you with deciding which of his **100 planes** he should take for each of his flights.

You will be told the number of Barry points each flight receives from `get_number_of_barry_points()` (in code already).

You must choose the flight to **maximise** the number of Barry points received, however you will **not know until you have flown** how many Barry points a flight will get.

Barry will be happy if he gets an average of **350 Barry points per flight**.
