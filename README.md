# 1.2 - Barry's Boeings

You've ended up in the orbit of Barry. He's the CEO at a major airline called **BarryJet** (haven't you heard of it?).

Boeing have sold him planes with faulty ailerons, but the replacement parts they sell are also faulty! After every flight they become faulty, and after 2 flights without repair, they go out of operation.

The MDP diagram below describes how one plane will be affected by flying and how much each action costs.

As in the above example, represent it as a Python dictionary, called `boeing_policy`.
