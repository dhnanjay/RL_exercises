To commemorate the anniversary of opening this restaurant, he wants to run an event for his customers. One Sunday evening after closing time, he builds a maze with obstacle-course elements in the restaurant. He hides prizes around the restaurant - vouchers for extra bacon or vegetable oil on your breakfast.

He then tests out the course and hidden prizes himself before deciding whether it's complete.

## Your Task

Calculate the return at each timestep of Barry's test run, given the rewards he receives in the test run.

The rewards are given as a list called `rewards`, where the first element `rewards[0]` corresponds to the reward at the first timestep.

The discount factor ùõæ is set to `gamma = 0.9` to discount future rewards.
